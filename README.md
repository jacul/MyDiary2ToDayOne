# MyDiary2ToDayOne
Convert database of MyDiary2 to DayOne's.

I decided to switch from MyDiary2 to DayOne for various reasons. Long story short, I need to export all my old journals to the new one. However it doesn't seem possible directly. Opening the database file with any SQL tool and the format is clear(yes it's not encrypted at all).

## ToDo:
* Not sure how image are stored in MyDiary2, I didn't have any. Need to check.
* DayOne doesn't support timezone for now. So when the database is imported, it will(probably) lose some data of timestamp. Need to update when they do support.
